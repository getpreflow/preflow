# preflow/folio

Folio is a drop-in CMS for Preflow. Require it into any Preflow app and you get a
shipped admin (mounted at a configurable path), content types defined as JSON, and
slug-based frontend rendering — without touching the framework.

## Installation

```bash
composer require preflow/folio
```

Requires PHP 8.4+. Composes `preflow/data`, `preflow/view`, `preflow/routing`, and
`preflow/form` (all already present in a standard Preflow app).

## Getting started

Folio is opt-in: a fresh Preflow skeleton does not wire it for you. Three small steps.

### 1. Register the service provider

In `config/providers.php`:

```php
return [
    \App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    \Preflow\Folio\FolioServiceProvider::class,
];
```

### 2. Choose the admin mount path (optional)

The admin mounts at `/folio` by default. To change it, add `config/folio.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
    'path' => '/admin', // or whatever doesn't collide with your app
];
```

### 3. Define a content type

Content types are JSON files in `config/models/` (the existing `data.models_path`).
Create `config/models/page.json`:

```json
{
    "key": "page",
    "table": "page",
    "storage": "json",
    "id_field": "uuid",
    "label": "Pages",
    "fields": {
        "title":  { "type": "string", "searchable": true, "validate": ["required"] },
        "slug":   { "type": "string", "searchable": true, "validate": ["required"] },
        "body":   { "type": "text" },
        "status": { "type": "string", "validate": ["required", "in:draft,published"] }
    }
}
```

That's it. Start the app and visit `/folio` — a **Pages** area appears with create / edit /
delete. Pages with `status: published` render on the public frontend at their `slug`
(e.g. `/about`), resolved by a lowest-priority catch-all so your own routes always win.

`storage: "json"` writes one flat file per record under `storage/data/page/` — zero
config, no migration. Switch a type to a database by changing `storage` to a configured
driver (e.g. `sqlite`); the admin and rendering are storage-agnostic.

## How it fits together

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Type definition (`page.json`) | `preflow/data` (`TypeRegistry`, `DynamicRecord`) |
| Record CRUD + validation | `preflow/data` (`DataManager::*Type()`) |
| Auto-form from the type | `preflow/form` |
| Shipped admin (dashboard, CRUD), routing, slug rendering | `preflow/folio` |

Admin and frontend templates live under `@folio/*` and are overridable: drop a same-named
template in `resources/folio/` to replace the shipped one.

## Overriding a core admin action

Shadow a single core action without forking by adding a class under
`App\Folio\Overrides\{Controller}\{Action}` implementing `OverridableAction`:

```php
namespace App\Folio\Overrides\Content;

use Preflow\Folio\Override\OverridableAction;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;

final class Index implements OverridableAction
{
    public function handle(ServerRequestInterface $request): ResponseInterface
    {
        // your custom dashboard
    }
}
```

## Status

Walking skeleton. Shipped: type discovery, auto-form CRUD, slug rendering, per-action
overrides. Not yet: rich-text / relation / asset / matrix fields, live preview, the full
extension layer, admin styling/assets, settings/users/media areas, i18n and versioning.
Templates are intentionally unstyled at this stage.
